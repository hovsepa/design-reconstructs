## <a name="directions"></a>Directions

This is an ongoing collection of screens for designers to recreate. The directions are simple, recreate a screen of your choosing in your favorite prototyping application. As you rebuild, note the use of padding, typography, heirarchy, size, color etc. You can do this in one of three modes:
1. Wireframe mode. Create a low fidelity wireframe. Just wires, no colors.
2. High-fidelity mode. Completely recreate the screen in all its detail.
3. All out. Create a wireframe first, duplicate the artboard and work on a high-fidelity mockup.

1. The wireframe, mockup or both in your application of choice (Sketch, AdobeXD, Axure, Figma, etc).
2. Brief answers to the following questions:
    * What are some design challenges you imagine designers met while creating this screen, and how did they solve them?
    * What were the most challenging elements for you as you worked through the mockup?
    * What additional elements could be improved about the overall design of this screen?

## <a name="faqs"></a>FAQs
* How do I find brand assets and what fonts are being used?
    > Brands usually have some element of their assets available on their website. (Google search "Brand name brand assets") You can go as deep as you would like with this, so if you want to get better at creating iconography feel free to also jump into Illustrator to recreate specific elements. There are also resources like [WhatTheFont](https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/) available if you crop the images and send them through.
* What screen should I design for?
    > The screens currently included are for iPhone X, but feel free to jump into the app and take a screenshot with a different phone if you would like.

That's all. Don't let the selection below stop you, you can recreate any screen you would like. Have fun!
